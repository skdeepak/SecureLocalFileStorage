Project: Securing Local File Storage 
************************************

We are going to design an application to Secure the Local Storage which will be portable and can be used for multiple platforms like Windows/Linux/Mac.

Abstract: The main idea is to secure our files from unauthorized access when we left our system standalone. 
		  And even when someone is able to access our files he/she will not 
		  be able to get any meaningful information from the files because all the data in files is encrypted.

Implementation: We will use python's pycrypto library to encrypt the data in files.

We have designed the code to encrypt the files in the last sem project.
Now we will be enhancing the code and will be adding more functionality to it i.e Counter Mode of encryption and Multiple Algorithms like AES-128, AES-192, AES-256.

Along with this, we have two mechanisms of operations:

1. The main application will encrypt all the files in the same directory and all the subdirectories in which the application is executed.

Benefit: Encrypt the files as quickly as possible to hide the information from the hackers.
Whenever the system is standalone the files will be encrypted.
Key will be saved in the system/USB itself in the hashed form.

The same program and the same key will be used to decrypt all the files.

What are the various modes of operations in which the AES can be used??
Python's basics and libraries that process cryptographic functions, os related functions, system related functions, random number genration.
What is hashing? (What is SHA Family of hashing?)
What is PBKDF2? how it works?
